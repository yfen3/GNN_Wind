# GNN based wind speed prediction 

This is the codebase for our wind speed predicion project based on graph neural network (GNN). 

## Description

The GNN is particularly effective to handle the graph data. The weather data collected by meteorological stations naturally form a graph data. This project targets predicting the wind speed using the GNN model. 

The data is publically avaiable at Weather Canada, the raw data are processed to be used in this project.
